# Black Friday Sales Analysis and Prediction
An EDA and purchase prediction for Black Friday sales data.

In this analysis I will do two things. Firstly I will explore the data and find some correlations between differents elements, so I can get some insights for future marketing strategies. On top of that I will also use regression method to predict future purchase.

Please see the Jupyter notebook(Black Friday Sales Analysis and Prediction.ipynb) for more details.

The dataset used in this analysis contains information of transactions in a store on Black Friday, including customers' demographical features and transaction details. The dataset comes from a competition hosted by Analytics Vidhya.
